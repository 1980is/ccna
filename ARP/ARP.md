# ARP #
- Recalling from our previous tasks that devices can have two identifiers: A MAC address and an IP address, the **ARP** protocol or **A**ddress **R**esolution **P**rotocol for short, is the technology that is responsible for allowing devices to identify themselves on a network. Simply, the ARP protocol allows a device to associate its MAC address with an IP address on the network. Each device on a network will keep a log of the MAC addresses associated with other devices. When devices wish to communicate with another, they will send a broadcast to the entire network searching for the specific device. Devices can use the ARP protocol to find the MAC address (and therefore the physical identifier) of a device for communication.
