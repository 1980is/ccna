# Loopback Interfaces #
- Loopback interfaces are logical interfaces.
- They allow you to assign an IP address to a router or L3 switch, which is not tied to a physical interface.
- Because they don't have any physical attributes which can fail, loopback interfaces never go down.
- Loopbacks are logical so they cannot be physically in the same subnet as other devices, so they are usually assigned a /32 subnet mask to avoid wasting IP addresses.
- It is best practice to assign a loopback interface to your routers.
- The loopback is commonly used for traffic that terminates on the router itself.
- This could be management traffic, Voice over IP, BGP peering etc.
- This provides redundancy if there are multiple paths to the router.
- The loopback is also used to identify the router (Router ID) in OSPF. 
- The loopback interface is usually used for multiple tasks (for) example management and BGP.
- Multiple loopbacks can be configured. This is not common and only usually done where another, seperate loopback is required for a special use case.
